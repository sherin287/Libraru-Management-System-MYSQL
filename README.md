# Library-Management-System-MYSQL
This project is developed using MySQL as the database management system to store and manage data related to books, branches, employees, customers, and the status of issued and returned books. The relational database ensures data integrity, scalability, and efficient retrieval of information.
Objectives of the Project:
Efficient Book Management: Maintain detailed records of all books in the library, including titles, authors, categories, rental prices, availability status, and publishers.

Customer and Employee Management: Record and manage customer and employee information, including registration details, contact information, and branch assignments.

Book Issuing and Returning: Track the issuance and return of books, including the date of issue, the customer who issued the book, and its return status.

Branch Management: Manage multiple library branches, each with its own set of employees and resources.

Reporting and Analysis: Provide insights into the total number of books, books issued, and customer activity to help librarians make informed decisions.
